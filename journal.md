# Interview Prep Journal

Today, on May 14th 2021, I start my interview preparation journey -- a marathon for honing my problem solving in data structures and algorithms. This journal is serves to document my work as I am following [this coding problem compilation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMdN_OCfOI0iAeDlqswCiC2DZzD4nPsb/view) which I found on [this Medium article](https://anubhavsinha98.medium.com/resources-to-master-data-structures-and-algorithms-24450dc6d52b).

I commit to solve at least two problems every day for the next 6 months or until the problem set is finished and push my solutions and written progress to this repository.
