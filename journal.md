# Interview Prep Journal

Today, on May 14th 2021, I start my interview preparation journey -- a marathon for honing my problem solving in data structures and algorithms. This journal is serves to document my work as I am following [this coding problem compilation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMdN_OCfOI0iAeDlqswCiC2DZzD4nPsb/view) which I found on [this Medium article](https://anubhavsinha98.medium.com/resources-to-master-data-structures-and-algorithms-24450dc6d52b).

I commit to solve at least two problems every day for the next 6 months or until the problem set is finished and push my solutions and written progress to this repository.

## May 14, 2021:
- Problem: [Reverse an array or a string](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/). My [solution](https://github.com/ak7588/interviewPrep/blob/main/reverseArray.py)
- Problem: [Find the middle element of a stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-with-find-middle-operation/). My [solution](https://github.com/ak7588/interviewPrep/blob/main/midStack.py)

I was travelling back home, hence the long pause between my commits.

## May 26, 2021:
- Problem: [Find the Kth smallest element in the array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-smallest-element5635/1). My code [solution](https://github.com/ak7588/interviewPrep/blob/main/kthSmallest.py)
